# ThinkIT Coffee Banner.

To run the project follow instructions below (im using yarn):

1. Clone the repository.
2. Go into the repo on your machine.
3. Run: `yarn` to install the dependencies.
4. Run: `yarn dev` to start the project on your machine.
5. Project should be accessible on port: http://localhost:5173/
6. There are two basic test for functions which you can check in src/**tests**
7. You can run them using the `yarn test` command.
8. This project is good for e2e testing, but there was no requirements to do it.

Instructions:

Go step by step using the application. You will be prompted with the banner code
at the end which you can copy and paste into your website.

-   As there was no instruction if the code that needed to be copied should be
    iframed, scripted or similar. I provided the basic <div> wrapped code.
